# Quest Of Fun Unlimited

RPG made using Python, Pygame and Tiled level editor.

Code implementation supports easy addition of new levels. New levels can be made with Tiled (with appropriate object layers, see already made levels.) and only few lines of code are needed to add them to the game. 

State machine structure is used to handle running and changing levels as well as sprite actions (moving/resting/npc automation).

Game assets are from opengameart with CC0 license and self made/modified.

## How to use

**Requirements:** Python 3.x.x and Pygame 2.x.x (Tiled if you want to edit levels/add new ones.)

**How to run:** python main.py

**How to play:** Use arrow keys to move and space to interact. (shift toggles running on/off)
