I have been researching old books and trying to find the clues about how to find the treasure. While exploring last time, I found a new secret passageway and traveled through it. But then I heard terrible noises coming from the darkness. I was scared that the monsters had returned and fled from the cave. Chickens Red, Green and Blue were accompanying me in my exploration. They always like to follow me. They were also scared of the noises and as we fled they got lost in the darkenss. I'm too old and afraid to go back there. You must save them! I have been trying to find the treasure for decades now. But now because of my obsession of finding it, I've lost my best chicken friends. Please, help! The entrance to the cave is short walk from here, just go north and accross the river. You are my only hope!"/>

    <property name="normal" value="Before the Time of Shadows the Mysterious Cave was excavated by the Guild of Miners. They were the descendants of the original inhabitants of the Sandy Cove. And as their ancestors, they got their livelyhood by mining for gold from the cave. As the time passed and miners wanted to get ever more wealthier they kept mining deeper and deeper into the mountain. In following the gold veins they came across a cave system that was already there deep inside the mountain. From there the miners found a gold treasure beyond their wildest imagination. However, it turned out that the hidden cave system deep in the mountain was also a home for ancient creatures. From time immemorial the creatures had been living there. Creatures did not like their peace being disturbed and their treasure being taken by the miners. The creatures drove miners from the cave and were thus released into the world as the terrifying monsters. That was the beginning of the Time of Shadows.  The Island of Anchyria became a desolate place, from where all people had to flee the terror of the monsters. History became legend... legend became myth. And for two and a half thousand years passed by. Even the of existence of the island of Anchyria faded from the memories and maps. People almost forgot. Then one day an old book was found, from which the tales of this book also come from. The book told about the island, it's history, gold treasure and the monsters. People got curious and band of heroes was formed. They sailed to Anchyria and fought the monsters. Heroes were valiant in their quest and managed to kill the creatures. After the victory had been achieved and the heroes tried to search for the gold treasure of immense wealth they did not find anything. The Mysterious Cave didn't even seem to contain the hidden cave system of the creatures, that was described in the old book... Heroes were celebrated for slaying the monsters nonetheless and The Island of Anchyria became inhabited again... This concludes our chapter of the ancient history and myths of The Island of Anchyria. &lt;~&gt;"/>
